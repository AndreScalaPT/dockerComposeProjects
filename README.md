# Docker Compose Projects
At the same time that I am increasing my knowledge with Docker, I am taking advantage and sharing these experiences in order to be able to help someone who follows these steps.

The way I have my Docker installation is inserted in the Linux /opt folder and with just one docker-compose.yaml file everything is aggregated into a single file allowing to update everything at once.

If you have any suggestions and/or any changes that you think are significant or that improve the facilities, please share them with us.
